Place a folder containing the data in the =data/= folder (mirroring the structure of the already existing files) and run the =concat_data.py= script from inside the =utils= folder.
Then run the following line of bash from within the =utils= folder.
#+begin_src bash
cat ../data/combined_data/train.src ../data/combined_data/train.mt > ../data/combined_data/train.src-trg
#+end_src

Then execute the =train_bpe_model.py= script from within the =utils= folder.

* Running the Experiment script
Change the respective variables in the =main()= function according to your requirements.
run =python experiment.py= from inside the root of the repository
